"""Shared helpers for kitchen's three Claude Code PreToolUse[Bash] roborev hooks:

  - roborev-pre-commit-context.py  — WARNS (injects open fail-verdict reviews
    into context before `git commit`); never blocks.
  - roborev-pre-push-gate.py       — DENIES a `git push` while the CURRENT branch
    has open fail-verdict reviews (after waiting for in-flight ones).
  - roborev-pre-checkout-gate.py   — DENIES a `git checkout`/`git switch` to
    ANOTHER branch while the branch you're LEAVING has open fail-verdict reviews
    (so findings can't be stranded by switching away). File restores
    (`git checkout -- f`, `git restore …`) are NOT gated — see
    `_is_branch_switch_args`.

All surfaces must agree on four things, so they live here in exactly one place:
  1. Claude's PreToolUse[Bash] request envelope,
  2. the command parser (is this a real `git <subcommand>` and which cwd?),
  3. roborev/git discovery,
  4. the DEFINITION of an "outstanding finding" (`_is_open_fail` + `_list_jobs`).

Underscore module name = importable from a sibling hook (the hyphenated hook
filenames are not valid Python module names). A hook runs with `sys.path[0]` set
to its own directory, so `from _roborev_hooklib import ...` resolves with no
sys.path hacks — the installer drops this file next to all three hooks.

This is NOT a security boundary. The command parser is a best-effort convenience
on operator-controlled machines; a few wrapped invocations (`ENV=x git commit`,
`cd d && git commit` from a non-repo cwd) intentionally no-op rather than growing
a shell emulator (settled across the #2 review's parser-probe rounds). roborev's
own git hooks fire regardless of what this hook recognizes.

    branch for another (the thing the checkout gate cares about), vs. restoring
    files / inspecting — which must NOT be gated.

    `args` is the token list AFTER the subcommand (options + operands, in order).

    A branch switch is:
      - `git switch <name>` / `git switch -c|-C <new>` / `git switch --detach
        <ref>` — `switch` is *always* a branch operation (it can't restore
        files), so any `switch` that isn't a pure no-op gates;
      - `git checkout <branch>` / `git checkout -b|-B <new>` / `git checkout -`
        (previous branch) / `git checkout --detach [<ref>]` (detach HEAD) — a
        checkout that leaves the branch rather than restoring a pathspec.

    NOT a branch switch (do NOT gate):
      - `git checkout -- <path>` (explicit pathspec after `--`),
      - `git checkout <ref> -- <path>` / `git checkout . ` / `git checkout <path>`
        where the operand is a pathspec (restore-from-tree), and
      - `git restore …` (never a branch op — not handled here; the caller only
        routes checkout/switch in).

    The hard case is bare `git checkout <arg>` with no `--`: `<arg>` could be a
    branch OR a path. We resolve it the way git's own ambiguity rule biases —
    and the way that's SAFE for this gate — as follows:
      - `-b`/`-B`/`-c`/`-C` (create-and-switch) or `-` (previous branch) present
        → unambiguously a branch switch → gate.
      - an explicit `--` (or `--pathspec-from-file`) → file op → do NOT gate.
      - exactly one non-option operand and NO `--` → treat as a BRANCH ref and
        gate. This is the deliberate call: `git checkout <oneword>` reads as "go
        to branch <oneword>" in agent usage; the rare `git checkout <file>` to
        discard one file's changes is virtually always written with the explicit
        `git checkout -- <file>` / `git restore <file>` (or `git checkout .`)
        forms, which we DON'T gate. We accept that a literal bare
        `git checkout somefile.py` MIGHT be over-gated (denied) when the branch
        has open fails — a safe failure (the agent restores via `git restore` /
        `git checkout --`), never an under-gate that lets a real switch slip.
      - two-or-more non-option operands, OR a single operand of `.`  → pathspec
        restore (`git checkout <ref> -- <paths>` collapses to ≥2 operands once
        `--` is stripped; `git checkout .` is the whole-tree restore) → do NOT
