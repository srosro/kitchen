"""PreToolUse[Bash] gate — DENY a Claude-initiated `git push` while the current
branch has outstanding roborev fail-verdict reviews, so findings get fixed or
acknowledged before code leaves the machine instead of accumulating unseen.

This is the deny-surface counterpart to roborev-pre-commit-context.py (the
warn-surface). The split is deliberate:

  - commit is too frequent + too early to block — you commit small and often
    while reviews run async, so the commit hook only WARNS (surfaces findings);
  - push is the export boundary — the right altitude for a hard gate. The deny
    isn't a security boundary (it's trivially bypassable on a box you control);
    it's a forcing function against the *silent-forget* failure mode: pushing
    over a `verdict=F` review you never looked at. It converts "forgot" into
    "consciously fixed it, or `roborev close`'d it."

Both surfaces import the SAME command parser, discovery, and outstanding-finding
definition (`_is_open_fail` / `_list_jobs`) from `_roborev_hooklib`, so they can
never disagree on what counts as an open finding.

ALLOWS (no-op) on anything that isn't a real `git ... push` segment, or when
roborev / git / the repo can't be resolved (best-effort; the binary is optional
on a base install and must not wedge every push).
It DENIES on (a) a confirmed open fail-verdict review, (b) in-flight reviews
that exceed the wait timeout, or (c) a review still in flight after the wait
(fail-closed — an unreviewed push can't slip through). Before denying on
in-flight work it first waits up to 600s for queued/running reviews to finish,
because commit→push-immediately is the normal flow and the daemon needs a moment
to catch up. (The native post-commit hook
enqueues synchronously — the review row is listable before control returns — so
a just-committed HEAD shows up as in-flight, not as an empty list.)

Scope limits (by design, not gaps):
  - Detached HEAD → allow. With no branch there's nothing to scope
    `roborev list --branch` to; denying would block every detached-HEAD push,
    including in repos roborev doesn't track. Branch-scoped gating simply
    doesn't apply.
  - A chained `git commit && git push` in ONE Bash call → not gated for that
    call: PreToolUse fires once, before the string runs, so the new commit (and
    its review) doesn't exist yet. Caught on the next standalone push once the
    review lands. Detecting a trailing push after a commit segment isn't worth
    the parser complexity for a bypass that's trivially available anyway.
  - Claude-Code-only: codex/human pushes aren't gated — these hooks teach the
    Claude Code agent the review loop.
